# magic_gamma_telescope
## Task :
We have to predict in which category rays are whether Gamma(g) or hadron(h)</br>

## Dataset:
The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique.</br>
Source: The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in:
    D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers,
    Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).

## Process
We are going to use supervised learning for this purpose.<br/><br/>
Steps for performing the task:<br/>
<b>1. Import the data:</b> <br/>
Make use of pandas library to import the dataset to the file<br/><br/>
<b>2. Clean the data:</b><br/>
Remove all the NULL value or unnecessary columns from the dataset to easy the process.<br/><br/>
<b>3. Split the data into 3 parts as Training, validation and testing:</b><br/>
Here we have taken 60% of data for training and the rest 20% each for Validation and Testing respectively.<br/><br/>
<b>4. Visualization of data:</b><br/>
We have plotted histogram to check the our features are affecting the output that is gamma or hadron<br/><br/>
<b>5. Create a model:</b><br/>
We have build 5 different model for this problem that are:<br/><br/>
. K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm<br/>
. Naive Bayes Algorithm<br/>
. Logistic Regression <br/>
. Support Vector Machine(SVM) Algorithm<br/>
. Neural Networks<br/><br/>
<b>6. Make Prediction and check accurarcy:</b><br/>
Finally for each of the model we have to check the prediction and accurarcy rate.<br/><br/>

Results: Out of all the 5 models we built . SVM present the best prediction and accuracy score.<br/><br/>
